      <p id="interesting-fact" class="stylef">A black panther is the melanistic colour variant found in members of <strong><em>the genus Panthera</em></strong>, particularly of the leopard in Asia and Africa, and the jaguar in the Americas. Black panthers of both species have excess black pigments, but their typical spotted markings are also present.The jaguar is a large felid species and the only extant member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. The jaguar is the largest cat species in the New World, and the third largest in the world. Due to convergent evolution, it closely resembles the leopard, but is usually larger and sturdier.
They're carnivores, which means they eat meat.</p>
